# dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles.

## Installation

Install Git
Install Stow
In $HOME run: `git clone git@github.com:Gauserr/dotfiles.git`
in the new dotfiles directory run: `stow .`
When conflicts emerge, use `rm` on the file that already exists on the machine, or copy it
as backup i.e `rm ~/.zshrc` or `mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.bak`

More updates to come.
